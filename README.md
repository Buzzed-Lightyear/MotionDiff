# MotionDiff
MotionDiff is a browser-based temporal frame differencing tool for revealing subtle motion in video.

## Algorithm

### Posy Blend (default)
Posy Blend compares the current frame against an older frame after inverting the old one:

`blend = (current + invert(old)) / 2`

For a static pixel, the math always collapses to the same midpoint:

`static pixel: (V + (255 - V)) / 2 = 128`

That is true for every possible input value `V`. The consequence is the signature MotionDiff look: the background cancels to gray, and motion glows away from gray. With RGB time-shift enabled, the color of that glow depends on which channel is comparing against which moment in time, so direction and speed become visible as colored fringes instead of plain luminance.

### Raw Diff
Raw Diff uses absolute channel difference:

`diff = |current - old|`

Static regions go to black, and brighter pixels mean larger motion between the two samples. It is the more literal mode: high contrast, easy to read, and good for simple motion detection when you do not need Posy mode's gray-centered directional color.

### Frame offset (k)
The frame offset chooses how far back in time the comparison reaches.

| k value | Best for |
|---------|----------|
| 1-3 | Fast motion, people walking, hand gestures |
| 5-15 | General nature footage, moderate motion |
| 20-40 | Slow drift, clouds, fog, rising steam |
| 50-90 | Imperceptibly slow motion, moonrise, tide |

### RGB channel time-shift
Instead of comparing all channels to the same old frame, MotionDiff can offset them in time:

- Red samples `k`
- Green samples `k + spread`
- Blue samples `k + spread x 2`

That stagger turns time into color. When an edge moves, each channel sees it at a slightly different temporal position, so the merged result becomes a directional smear rather than a white outline.

```text
time:     now  <- current frame
R old:    t - k
G old:    t - (k + spread)
B old:    t - (k + spread x 2)
```

### Trail accumulation
Trail accumulation merges the last `T` diff frames into one image.

- Posy mode keeps the value with the largest deviation from 128 on each channel.
- Raw Diff keeps the largest raw channel value on each channel.

`T = trail length`, so larger values hold motion on screen longer. Short trails show immediate movement. Long trails turn motion into persistent streaks and ghosted silhouettes.

### Threshold
Threshold suppresses noise before accumulation.

- Low threshold: more sensitive, more noise.
- High threshold: cleaner image, but subtle motion can disappear.

### Display modes
| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Diff | Raw algorithm output only |
| Overlay | Motion screen-blended onto original frame |
| Glow | Original + amplified additive bloom from motion |

Layer dependencies are intentionally strict:

```text
core/ <- no imports
app/  <- core/ only
ui/   <- app/ only
main.js <- app/ + ui/
```

## Development
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd motiondiff
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173/MotionDiff/
npm test        # run core unit tests
npm run build   # production build
```

## Renderer
MotionDiff detects WebGL2 at runtime and uses it when available; otherwise it falls back to a Canvas 2D + Worker pipeline. The console logs which renderer is active, so you can confirm the path immediately on load.

The WebGL renderer uploads frame data with `texImage2D` and keeps diff, blur, accumulation, and composite passes on the GPU. That avoids reading processed pixels back to the CPU every frame. The renderer also includes a `VideoFrame -> texImage2D` upload path, which is the ideal zero-readback direction for browser-native frame processing.

## Tests
Core coverage is focused on the pure functions under `src/core/`, including diff math, blur, buffer behavior, trails, and analysis helpers. Run the suite with `npm test`. The current suite contains 27 passing tests.
